1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
# Answer:
Based on the provided schema, it seems there's no direct relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities. However, we can infer that the "category_id" column in the "Product" table likely serves as a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "product_category" table. This implies a one-to-many relationship where each product belongs to one category, and each category can have multiple products.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
# Answer:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can enforce referential integrity by setting up a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the "id" column in the "product_category" table. This constraint will ensure that every value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table corresponds to a valid category ID in the "product_category" table.
