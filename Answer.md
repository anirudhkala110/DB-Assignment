1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
2. # Answer:
3. Based on the provided schema, it seems there's no direct relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities. However, we can infer that the "category_id" column in the "Product" table likely serves as a foreign key referencing the "id" column in the "product_category" table. This implies a one-to-many relationship where each product belongs to one category, and each category can have multiple products.
